# My-Colorful-Webpage
To make your webpage colorful, you'll need to use HTML and CSS.
This is a webpage with dynamic color styling. You can toggle between a light color scheme and a dark color scheme using the button at the top right. The colors of the background, headings, and text will all change.

The styling is done using CSS, and the theme is switched using JavaScript. The font is Verdana, which is a very readable sans-serif font.
